# Introduction
A quick starter project that I use to build rule-based Facebook Messenger chatbots.

# Features
- Modular, can extend its features by using a system of packages and modules
- Manages user personal folders (used to store user specific files)

**This chatbot is only supposed to be hosted on Heroku at the moment.**

```
